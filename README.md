day 20 and 21 of 100 day python coding challenge
# Snake Game

This Python program is a simple Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

## How it Works
The game initializes with a snake and a piece of food on the screen. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen. After the game ends, the player has the option to play again.

## Features
- Classic Snake game experience.
- Player-controlled snake movement.
- Food spawning and snake growth mechanics.
- Game over screen with the option to play again.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Turtle graphics library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/snake.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd snake
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python snake.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and eat the food. Avoid collisions with the snake's body and the screen boundaries.

5. After the game ends, enter 'yes' to play again or 'no' to exit.

## Example

```python
python snake.py
```

```
The game starts...
You lost! Game over.
Play Again! Enter 'yes' or 'no': yes
```
