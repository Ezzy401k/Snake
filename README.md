# Snake Game


This Python program is a classic implementation of the Snake game using the Turtle graphics library.

## Overview

In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself while trying to eat as much food as possible.

## Features

- Control the snake's movement using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Scoreboard to keep track of the player's score.
- Colorful graphics and smooth animation.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/snake.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd snake
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python snake.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
5. Eat the food (green dots) to grow longer.
6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
7. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Dependencies

- Python 3
